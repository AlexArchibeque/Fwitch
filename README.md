# [Fwitch](https://fwitch.herokuapp.com/#/) 
Fwitch is a single page app styled interactive [twitch.tv](twitch.tv) clone. 
Users can edit their stream layouts, upload clips, and change their streaming titles while the site gets updated dynamically.

### Technologies used
For fwitch, I used a full stack of technologies consisting of:
* **Backend**
  * Ruby on Rails
  
     Handles all the backend requests and sends back the json of the requested data from the frontend.
* **FrontEnd**
  * React 
      
     Handles the views and works with the backend using Ajax calls to retriev data. Stored in the /frontend folder.
  * Redux
    
    Manages the state of the program for the fronted, holding data retrieved from the backend for future or current use.

### Features
* [User Authentication](https://github.com/AlexArchibeque/Fwitch/edit/main/README.md/#Authentication)
* Carousel of Videos
